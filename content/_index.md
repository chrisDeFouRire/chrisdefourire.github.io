I'm [@ChrisHartwigSSL](https://twitter.com/ChrisHartwigSSL), a backend engineer, entrepreneur and SSL expert.

I want to share with you experiences and thoughts I have about various techs and organisations.

In 2015 I launched SSLping.com which gained some popularity, while working on a gaming backend as a service called [Xtralife](https://github.com/xtralifecloud) and a project called [Geeo](https://github.com/GeeoIO), both Opensource now. I do have a thing for backend, devops and SSL/TLS stuff but I'm not good as a solo founder.

__I'm currently looking for an exciting position!__

I've worked remotely from abroad since 2014, traveling between UTC-4 to UTC+8, from Martinique in the Caribbean🏝️ to Malta🇲🇹 and Spain🇪🇸, Mauritius🇲🇺, Malaysia🇲🇾, the Philippines🇵🇭, Thailand🇹🇭, Cambodia🇰🇭 and Vietnam🇻🇳. Also I'm French.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophe-hartwig-ba228a5/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisDeFouRire).
